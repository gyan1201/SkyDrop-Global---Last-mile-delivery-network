To effectively build the software and AI production unit for drones:
The team involves developing a proprietary "SkyMind" AI system, which serves as the brain of the network. This system is intended to handle complex tasks like real-time route optimization for millions of concurrent flights, weather prediction integration, collision avoidance with extreme reliability (99.9999%), and natural language processing for customer interaction.
